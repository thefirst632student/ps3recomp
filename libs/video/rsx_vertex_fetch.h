/*
 * ps3recomp - RSX guest vertex fetch
 *
 * Reading a vertex out of guest memory is RSX semantics, not host-API
 * semantics: big-endian components, the NV4097 type encodings, the vertex
 * frequency divisor, and the context-DMA bit in the array offset. Nothing
 * about it is specific to D3D12, Metal or anything else.
 *
 * It nevertheless existed twice -- once in rsx_d3d12_backend.c and again in
 * rsx_metal_backend.m, whose header openly said "ported from the D3D12
 * backend's read_vp_vertex" -- and the two copies had already drifted apart in
 * two ways that matter:
 *
 *   - A DISABLED attribute array must feed the constant vertex attribute
 *     register (NV4097_SET_VERTEX_DATA4F_M), exactly like glColor4f with the
 *     colour array switched off. The D3D12 copy learned this the hard way
 *     (defaulting to black multiplied Rubber Ducky's duck texture away); the
 *     Metal copy substituted caller-supplied literals and never read the
 *     register at all.
 *
 *   - A LOCAL (VRAM) array offset must resolve as local. Routing it through
 *     cellGcmResolveOffset lets the IO table win for any offset whose page the
 *     IO window also covers, and the array silently reads from empty main
 *     memory. The D3D12 copy resolves LOCAL explicitly; the Metal copy did
 *     not, which is that bug still sitting there.
 *
 * So this is the D3D12 version, which is the one that has met real games,
 * lifted out to a single definition. A third backend that needs vertices calls
 * this rather than porting the logic a third time.
