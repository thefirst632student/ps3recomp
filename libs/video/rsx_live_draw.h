/*
 * ps3recomp - Track B live NV4097 draw path (LAYER 2 -> live backend)
 *
 * The offline capture-replay harness (libs/video/tests/replay_main.c) proved a
 * full NV4097 -> D3D12 draw pipeline: the rsx_dispatch register-file model
 * feeds an NV40 VP/FP -> HLSL decompiler and a PSO/sampler/texture engine that
 * renders real geometry into a color surface. This module lifts that engine out
 * of the harness so the LIVE FIFO consumer (yakuza/import_overrides.cpp
 * yz_rsx_method) can drive it with the game's own method stream, rendering into
 * a D3D12 present surface.
 *
 * Data flow (live):
 *   game (t1) writes NV methods to the FIFO ring
 *     -> yz_rsx_method(method, arg)                         [existing hook]
 *        -> rsx_live_draw_method(method, arg)               [this module]
 *           -> rsx_dispatch_method(...)  (register file + BEGIN/END/DRAW/FLIP)
 *              -> sink callbacks -> D3D12 PSO + draw into the flip surface
 *   flip method (0xE944) -> rsx_live_draw_present(buffer_id) -> Present()
 *
 * The whole path is gated by the RSX_DRAW env flag (see docs/FLAGS.md): when
 * unset/"0" the live draw engine is inert and the runtime keeps its existing
 * (null / clear-color) present, so this is a pure add-on with a kill switch.
 *
 * Clean-room: method numbers/semantics from envytools rnndb + Mesa nv30 +
 * psdevwiki; RPCS3 consulted only as a read-only fact oracle. No GPL code.
 *
 * Windows/D3D12 only; a no-op stub compiles elsewhere.
