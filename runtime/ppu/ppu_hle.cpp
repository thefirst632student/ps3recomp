/*
 * ps3recomp - PPU HLE bridge (NID -> host function dispatch)
 *
 * Connects the recompiled game's firmware imports to our HLE C libraries.
 * The game calls an imported function through its import stub; the lifter
 * emits `ps3_hle_call(<NID>, ctx)` for those addresses (see ppu_lifter.py
 * --imports). This resolves the NID to a registered HLE handler and marshals
 * the PPC calling convention into a native C call.
 *
 * PPC64 ELFv1 integer/pointer ABI: arguments in r3..r10 (gpr[3..10]), return
 * value in r3. The generic adapter casts the handler to a uint64-in/uint64-out
 * function and passes the 8 GPR argument slots; this covers the large majority
 * of cellXxx APIs (integer args/handles, s32 return). Functions that take or
 * return *pointers* need host<->guest address translation and so require a
 * per-function wrapper -- the generic path passes the raw value through.
 *
 * Compiled as C++ (matches the lifted output). Game-agnostic.

/* An unresolved NID is a firmware import we never registered. Returning
 * CELL_OK "so the game keeps going" is the single biggest source of
 * days-long debugging in this project: the title reads back untouched
 * out-params and proceeds on fabricated state, then deadlocks or crashes
 * far from the actual gap. The unregistered mouse (a phantom device polled
 * forever) and six whole modules whose names never matched a source file
 * all reached the game this way.
 *
 * So: report every DISTINCT unresolved NID exactly once (not a global
 * first-40 cap that hides everything after the 40th unique import), count
 * how often each is hit, and make the fabricated return an explicit CHOICE
 * rather than the silent default.
 *
 * The default stays CELL_OK, because faking is currently LOAD-BEARING: LBP
 * calls cellFsSdataOpen (0xB1840B53, its encrypted data file) and cellHttpsInit
 * (0x522180BC) during early boot and shuts down cleanly if either fails, so
 * PS3_HLE_UNRESOLVED=fail dies at 144 log lines vs ~148,000. The days-long
 * debugging was never caused by the fake per se -- it was caused by the fake
 * being SILENT (a global first-40-line cap hid every import past the 40th). So
 * the fix is visibility: report each DISTINCT unresolved NID once, with a hit
 * count, always. `fail` remains available to A/B which missing import is
 * load-bearing -- run it and read the two or three NIDs it reports.
 *
 *   PS3_HLE_UNRESOLVED = ok   (default): r3 = CELL_OK, reported once per NID.
