/* spurs_policy.c — run a SPURS workload's policy module on a lifted SPU.
 *
 * The real SPURS kernel dispatches a workload by loading its policy module
 * (a raw SPU binary) at LS 0xA00 and entering it with the ABI of
 * cellSpursModuleEntry(uintptr_t context, uint64_t ea):
 *
 *   r0 = return-to-kernel address     r3 = kernel context LS address (0x100)
 *   r1 = stack (the PM re-loads its   r4 = the workload's u64 data (preferred
 *        own initial stack)                doubleword) — e.g. a joblist EA
 *                                     r5 = poll status
 *
 * The SpursKernelContext fields this fills, per the layout RPCS3 documents
 * (Emu/Cell/Modules/cellSpurs.h, struct SpursKernelContext) and the lifted
 * wwsjob PM verifiably reads. NOTE both pointers are 64-BIT:
 *   0x1C0 be u64 spurs EA           0x1D8 be u32 wklCurrentUniqueId
 *   0x1C8 be u32 spuNum             0x1DC be u32 wklCurrentId
 *   0x1CC be u32 dmaTagId           0x1E0 be u32 exitToKernelAddr
 *   0x1D0 be u64 wklCurrentAddr     0x1E4 be u32 selectWorkloadAddr
 *        (PM base 0xA00, in the LOW word at 0x1D4)
 *
 * exitToKernel/selectWorkload point at two reserved LS addresses below the PM
 * base; spu_indirect_branch intercepts them (ctx->policy_mode) and HLEs the
 * kernel side: select = "no contention, keep running", exit = end of run.
