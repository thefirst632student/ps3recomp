 *     routed to the DMA engine (spu_dma.h); mailboxes, signal notification,
 *     events and the decrementer use the spu_context channel fields.
 *   - spu_indirect_branch : resolves ctx->pc to a lifted spu_func_* via a

 * The MFC engine state is kept per spu_context here (spu_context.h does not

 *     that races a claim either matches (its own slot, which only it can have
 *     written) or does not, and can never be handed another context's engine.
 *   - Choosing which free slot to claim is done under a lock. It used to be a
 *     scan followed by a store, and two threads that scanned before either
 *     stored both took the same slot and then shared one engine's queue and tag
