 * plain: a bit per 128-byte line, a small table of the SPU contexts that have
 * ever reserved one, and the lock-line spinlock. Everything that WRITES it runs
 * with the lock-line lock held (the SPU's GETLLAR, the PPU's coherent store),
 * so the read-modify-write on a shared bitmap byte is serialized. Only
 * spu_coh_is_reserved reads without the lock, which is the entire point: it is
