"""Fall-through checks for the PPU lifter: a function whose LAST instruction is
a conditional branch must record a fall-through continuation.

The bug this pins: _last_line_is_terminator treated any line containing
`goto ` as an unconditional terminator, including the conditional forms the
lifter emits for bc/bdnz (`if (...) goto loc_X;`). A function cut at a
conditional branch -- a loop fragment the boundary pass split off, whose exit
path is the next function in address order -- then got no fall-through
trampoline. When the branch was not taken the C function just returned: the
guest function "returned" mid-body, its stack frame still pushed and its
callee-saved registers never restored.

Seen in MAG (BCUS98110): func_0115C850, the member loop of Havok's hkClass
walk, ends `bne loc_0115C850` and falls through to func_0115C8C0. Every loop
exit came back two frames deep with the caller's r26/r31 clobbered, the outer
member loop ran to index 2746, and a parent-chain walk overran a 4-slot buffer
into the allocator's free list. 69 functions in that title had this shape.
