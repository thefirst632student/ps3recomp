"""Unit vectors for discover_jump_tables: which lwzx operand is the table base.

No SDK, no ELF: the PowerPC words are hand-assembled and memory is a dict, so
this runs anywhere python does. Every word is round-tripped through
ppu_disasm.decode first, so an encoding mistake here reports as ENCODING and
never as a false lifter failure.

The bug this pins: `lwzx rD, rA, rB` computes MEM(rA + rB), so either operand
can be the table base, and both are often defined by an r2-relative load (the
base from its TOC slot, the index from a TOC-addressed global). The `add`-based
reordering in discover_jump_tables only promotes a candidate when an `add`
combines the loaded value with it -- the OFFSET-table idiom. An ABSOLUTE table
has no `add`, so the candidates stayed in raw operand order and the first one
that resolved was taken as the base without its table ever being scored. When
that was the index register, the table read from its slot validated zero case
targets, `best` stayed empty and the dispatcher was dropped with no message.
The bctr then lifted to an unresolved indirect call.

The fix scores every operand that resolves, the way the multi-TOC loop already
scores TOC candidates, and keeps the one that validates the most targets. Ties
go to the earlier candidate, so a dispatcher only changes when the base picked
before validated strictly fewer targets. The vectors below cover the defect,
the offset idiom that must not move, and the tie-break.
