"""Port regression gate.

Runs each registered port, captures its milestone log (see
include/ps3emu/milestone.h) and diffs it against a checked-in golden. This is
what makes it safe to change the shared runtime: the titles are not all being
actively worked on, so without this nothing tells you that a fix for one game
silently broke another.

    python tools/regress.py list
    python tools/regress.py record vf5        # capture a new golden
    python tools/regress.py check vf5         # diff against it
    python tools/regress.py check --all       # every registered port

Ports are registered in tools/regress_ports.toml; goldens live beside it in
tools/regress/. Game binaries are never in the repo, so a port whose directory
or executable is missing is reported as SKIPPED rather than failing -- the gate
has to be usable by someone who owns two of the seven titles.

What counts as a failure:

  LOST     a key the golden has and this run does not. A call the title used to
           make and no longer does. Always a failure -- except for an
           hle:unresolved:* key, whose disappearance means the import gained a
           handler; that is reported as RESOLVED and passes.
  UNRESOLVED  a firmware import that has BECOME unresolved. Always a failure,
           even though it is a "new" key. The mirror image of RESOLVED.
  DROPPED  an occurrence count that fell by an order of magnitude, or a scalar
           that went down. Rendering stopping looks like this.

  NEW / RAISED / ORDER are reported but do not fail: they are as likely to be
  progress as regression, and a gate that cries wolf gets ignored.

A port's `expect` says what finishing looks like: "timeout" (it reached a frame
loop and never exits -- the usual case), "exit0" (a clean exit), or "any" (the
terminal state is not stable enough to assert; compare the milestones only).
