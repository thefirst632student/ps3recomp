"""Branch-dispatch emission checks for the PPU lifter.

Complements test_ppu_lift.py: that suite compiles emitted statements and runs
them against register inputs, which can't cover branch dispatch (it needs the
runtime's ps3_indirect_call + trampoline). These assert the emission SHAPE --
call vs return -- which is where the class of bug below lives.

The bug this pins: blrl (branch to LR *with link*) is an indirect CALL, the
LR-based twin of `mtctr;bctrl`, emitted for function-descriptor calls as
`lwz r12,0(rN); mtlr r12; lwz r2,4(rN); blrl`. It was lumped with blr (return)
and emitted a bare `return;`, which dropped the call AND skipped the frame
epilogue -> r1 leaked the frame size on every such call.

Usage:  py -3 tools\\test_ppu_branches.py
